# ðŸš€ FastAPI-Best-Practices

**FastAPI-Best-Practices** is a fully structured and production-ready backend architecture template for building clean, scalable microservices using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It is designed to get you started instantly with a modern developer experience, reliable patterns, and strong isolation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

This architecture is tailored for **single-purpose microservices**â€”tiny services that solve a specific domain problem with minimal endpoints, consumers, or background tasks.

You can create **hundreds of services** like these with ease by reusing this template. Just clone the repo, rename the service, and write your business logic on top of a rock-solid foundation.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use This?

FastAPI-Best-Practices helps you:

- Skip boilerplate setup and focus on your serviceâ€™s core logic
- Follow well-known backend principles (like Clean Architecture)
- Improve developer experience with modern tooling and clear patterns
- Reduce complexity when building horizontally scalable services

It is **not a monolith**. Each service is meant to live in its own repository and solve **one focused responsibility**.
